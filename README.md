# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This is a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using a Netflix dataset. The goal was to strengthen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and working with real-world datasets using Python.

---

## 📌 Objective

To gain hands-on practice with essential data analysis tools and techniques through a focused analysis of Netflix content data.

---

## 🔍 What I Explored

- 🎬 **Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows**  
  *Visualized with a pie chart to understand content type spread.*

- 🎭 **Top Genres**  
  *Identified the most frequently occurring genres on Netflix.*

- 🌍 **Country-wise Content Trends**  
  *Analyzed release trends across different countries.*

- 📅 **Average Release Year**  
  *Looked at when most of the content was released.*

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**  
  *Handled missing values and removed duplicates.*

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** – for basic plots  
- **Seaborn** – for advanced visualizations

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Practical use of EDA techniques
- Confidence in using Pandas and Seaborn
- Importance of storytelling with data
- How even simple datasets can offer deep insights when analyzed well

---

## 📈 Next Steps

- Explore interactive visualizations using Plotly or Altair  
- Work on more complex datasets  
- Practice building dashboards for data storytelling
